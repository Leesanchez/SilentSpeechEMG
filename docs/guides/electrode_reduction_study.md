# Electrode Reduction Study Guide

This guide outlines our methodology for studying EMG electrode reduction while maintaining prediction accuracy in silent speech recognition.

## Overview

The study aims to determine the optimal number and placement of EMG electrodes needed for accurate silent speech recognition, with the goal of reducing the system's complexity while maintaining performance.

## Methodology

### 1. Baseline Establishment (8 Electrodes)
- Record complete dataset using all 8 electrodes
- Train baseline model and establish performance metrics
- Document electrode positions and muscle groups covered

### 2. Feature Importance Analysis
- Calculate mutual information between each electrode's signals and predicted text
- Analyze cross-correlation between electrode pairs
- Identify redundant information across channels
- Generate feature importance rankings

### 3. Electrode Reduction Process
1. **Channel Selection**
   - Rank electrodes by importance score
   - Identify minimal set covering all critical muscle groups
   - Consider both individual and combined contribution

2. **Validation**
   - Train models with reduced electrode sets (7, 6, 5, 4, 3)
   - Compare performance metrics across configurations
   - Analyze impact on specific phonemes/words

3. **Optimization**
   - Fine-tune electrode placement for reduced sets
   - Test different combinations of high-ranking electrodes
   - Evaluate trade-offs between accuracy and electrode count

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Word Error Rate (WER)
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Real-time processing capability
- User comfort and system usability

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Synthetic Data Analysis
```python
# Example code for analyzing electrode importance
def analyze_electrode_importance(signals, predictions):
    importance_scores = []
    for channel in range(8):
        mi_score = mutual_information(signals[channel], predictions)
        importance_scores.append(mi_score)
    return importance_scores
```

### Phase 2: Real Data Validation
- Validate findings with real EMG data when available
- Adjust electrode positions based on anatomical considerations
- Refine reduction strategy based on empirical results

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Optimal Configuration**
   - Recommended number of electrodes (target: 3-4)
   - Specific placement locations
   - Expected performance metrics

2. **Trade-off Analysis**
   - Performance vs. electrode count curve
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - User comfort assessment

3. **Scientific Contribution**
   - Novel methodology for electrode reduction
   - Empirical evidence for minimal required channels
   - Practical guidelines for implementation

## Future Work

- Integration with adaptive placement algorithms
- Real-time electrode optimization
- User-specific configuration recommendations
- Extended validation across different languages/accents
